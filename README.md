A-LOAM-colorize is a version of A-LOAM to which I add some basic image fusion funciton to the original A-LOAM developed by HKUST, mainly in laser_mappping.cpp.

mid_term_demno.pptx is the mid term demonstation of our Student Research Training Program, in which I take charge of processing the Lidar and camera data.
